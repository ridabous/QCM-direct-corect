# QCM-direct-corect
basic qcm correcteur with fonctions to rotate the subject paper.
it's a  GUI application using PyQt4, open cv biblio and numpy .
the maximum angle rotation for this function is 45Â° .
Project QCM : without an OCR function 
Project-MAJ : with basic OCR operation to save the name of the studen and save  it with his score(you must install Tesseract exe for window or pytesseract and change the code because i used os system to run tesseract)
to run the project be sure  that you have already (numpy ,open cv ,pyqt). 
run instruction : run the file Princ.py
Thank you
